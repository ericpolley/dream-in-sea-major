Alone at the edge of a 
universe humming a tune
For merely dreaming we were snow
A siren sounds like the goddess who
Promises endless apologies of paradise
And only she can make it right
So things are different tonight
We'll go together in flight
It's now and never
A reverie endeavor
Awaits somnambulant directives
To take the helm
Believe me, darling
The stars were made for falling
Like melting obelisks
As tall as another realm
Un ensemble d'enfants
La galaxie s'étend
Jardin de l'imagination
Combler la lacune
Voler face à la lune
                </p></pre></div>

Vois comme nous évoluons
It feels like flying
But maybe we're dying
A cosmic confluence of
Pyramids hologrammed
She knows you heard her
Staging music murder
In line before the show began
To be where I am
Children born of one emotion
Our devotion's deepest ocean
No division reasoned 
we'll be free
To know
We are beyond a bow
And lo, the hues arrange to show
It's perfectly clear
You look quite divine tonight
Here among these vibrant lights
Pure delights surround 
us as we sail
                </p></pre></div>

                    <p>      
Signed, yours truly, the whale
Joy mirage's kingdom come
No one left at stake
Now that existence 
is on the wake
Let's see what we can make
The part is wholly ending
A line in any final song
So long, so far
We will be atoning
At last eternal through the past
Above a blinding star
Bye, hi
Sigh, Hawaii
We never meant to part
Sublime, thy art
One light
Higher than the sun
Invisible to some
Until it's time</p></pre></div>
